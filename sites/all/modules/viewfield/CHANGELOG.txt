Viewfield 5.x-1.x, 2007-02-05
-----------------------------
by mfredrickson: Fixed ID for author argument token.
  Was using node ID instead of user ID.
#100971 by eaton, webchick, alex_b, yched, and stefano73: Updated to Drupal 5.
  Some changes to the implementation:
  * More reliance on the views formatters (as seems to be the norm for CCK
    fields now) for formatting regular node views.
  * The full node formatter is now the "default". This may break some existing
    views. It's worth the pain.
  * Added paging as per stefano73/alex_b's work. Relatively untested, but it
    looks good so far. (Thanks!)


Viewfield 4.7.x-1.x, 2006-11-10
-------------------------------
by mfredrickson: Initial commit.
  Nodes hold content. Views save queries. Wouldn't be great if a node could hold
  a saved query? Now it can. Viewfield is a CCK field module that allows
  administrators to put views directly into nodes. When creating a node, users
  can select from a list of views. When the node is displayed, the view is run
  and the content is inserted into the body of the node.
