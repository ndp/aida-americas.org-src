NICE MENUS UPGRADES
===================
5.x, 6.x-1.x ---> 6.x-2.x
-------------------------
There is an update hook and you should run update.php to get things moved around properly.

Aside from the minor database changes, there are a number of things you should be aware, especially in light of any customizations you may have made.

THEME FUNCTIONS RENAMED
The theme functions have all been renamed to be more in line with Drupal standards, so if you are overwriting the functions in your theme's template.php or calling the functions anywhere in your theme, you should update the function names. The old functions were called theme_nice_menu_* and the new ones are theme_nice_menus_*, with an "s" to match the module name. There is a legacy wrapper to make the old name continue to work, but they will be removed in Drupal 7, so you should switch them over now.

NEW JAVASCRIPT
The old JS has been completely removed and replaced with JS that uses the Superfish jQuery plugin. It now fires for ALL browsers by default, unless you turn the JS off in your settings at Administer > Site configuration > Nice menus (admin/build/nice_menus). If you had "Enable IE support" checked under older versions of NM, then the new JS will be on by default. If it was unchecked in your older version, then the update will turn JS off for you by default. If you turn JS off on the site (or a visitor comes without JS enabled), IE6 will no longer get the dropdown effect, but all other browsers will fall back to CSS-only dropdowns.


4.7 ---> 5.x
------------
The CSS class has changed to change the underscore (_) to a dash (-)
The 4.7 version of class="nice_menu" is now class="nice-menu" in version 5.
You will need to adjust any Custom CSS you have added to account for this.
The default CSS that comes with nice_menus uses this new convention already.

Also note that the layout CSS for the module has been broken out into a
separate CSS file (nice_menus_default.css). You have the option of replacing
this file by creating a separate customized CSS file, and overriding the
default CSS file at Administer -> Themes -> Configure -> Global settings ->
"Path to custom nice menus CSS file".
